### Bugs

Note: please report anything that's a pain in the arse as a bug
or if you just have a bug up your arse.

I'm using Oracle database (which can be a pain in the arse)

Uses read-string to read the configuration file, please only use a file you've written yourself or that you trust, else you run the risk of having a bad time.

### Additional considerations: 
### 

This is my first enterprise clojure application
I'm also not a whizbang database programmer
if you think you can do it better, you're probably right.
